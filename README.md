📘 05 – Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 (Programming Advice)

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 course on the [AbouHadhood Platform](https://programmingadvices.com/l/dashboard)! 🏆

This repository contains algorithmic problems and solutions from Level 2, focusing on deepening problem-solving skills while applying the Divide & Conquer approach.

🚀 Course Overview

This phase focused on:

Diving deeper into algorithms and problem-solving strategies.

Refining structured programming skills.

Following the principle of Divide & Conquer: breaking each problem into small, focused functions & procedures, each with a single responsibility, to ensure clean, readable, and reusable code.

💡 Key Highlights

Implementing functions from scratch instead of relying on built-in cmath functions: abs(), round(), floor(), ceil(), sqrt().

Practicing decomposition and function design.

Strengthening debugging and optimization skills.

Completing two hands-on projects that applied everything learned.

🛠 Technologies Used

Language: C++

Paradigm: Structured Programming

Tools: VS Code / Dev-C++, Git, GitHub

🔜 Next Steps

After completing Level 2, I advanced to Level 3 – Algorithms & Problem Solving, which introduces more complex challenges and advanced concepts.
