📘 **05 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 (Programming Advices)**

🎉 I’m happy to share that I’ve completed the **05 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 2** course on [AbouHadhood Platform](https://abouhadhood.com/) 🏆

This repository contains **algorithmic problems and solutions** from Level 2, focusing on deepening problem-solving skills while applying the **Divide & Conquer** approach.

---

🚀 **Course Overview**

This phase was all about:

- Diving deeper into algorithms and problem-solving strategies.
- Refining structured programming skills.
- Staying true to the principle: **Divide & Conquer**.

We broke every problem into small, focused functions & procedures—each with a single responsibility—ensuring **clean, readable, and reusable code**.

---

💡 **Key Highlights**

- **Implementing functions from scratch** instead of relying on built-in `cmath` library functions:
  - `abs()`
  - `round()`
  - `floor()`
  - `ceil()`
  - `sqrt()`
- Practicing **decomposition** and function design.
- Strengthening **debugging** and **optimization** skills.
- Wrapping up with two **hands-on projects** applying everything learned.

🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **Language:** C++  
- **Paradigm:** Structured Programming  
- **Tools:** VS Code / Dev-C++, Git, GitHub

🔜 **Next Steps**

After completing Level 2, I advanced to **Level 3 – Algorithms & Problem Solving**, which introduces more complex challenges and advanced concepts.
